The collection of open-source datasets created by the DISTINT group, JNU

## Dataset I: Human vs. AI-translated Multilingual Corpora (HAM)
**Description**: High-quality multilingual parallel corpora (mostly public) paired with LLM-generated two-way translation. This dataset can be used for multiple purposes such as machine translation detection, translation fidelity evaluation, etc.

## Dataset II: Homologous Question-Answering Dataset (Homologous-QA)
A derived Question-answering dataset. Each question has multiple homologous questions that share the same entity but differ in logic. This dataset can be used for evaluating Language models, retrieval algorithms, and RAG systems in terms of output consistency and knowledge multiplexing.
